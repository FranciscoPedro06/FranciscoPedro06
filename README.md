hi there — i'm Francisco Pedro, 18yo dev who enjoys turning coffee into code ☕

i build things using:
  - ☕ java & 🧠 c for logic-heavy challenges
  - 🧮 sql for data wrangling
  - 🌐 js, html & css for bringing ideas to the browser

less into buzzwords, more into learning by doing.

⌛ currently diving deeper into:
  - backend patterns
  - clean architecture
  - database optimization

always learning. always building.  
sometimes debugging for hours because of a missing semicolon.
